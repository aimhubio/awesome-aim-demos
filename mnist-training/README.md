# MNIST Training

A simple script for training a CNN on the MNIST dataset.
Aim is instrumented to track model performance metrics, images and plotly figures.

## Get Started

This app already includes logs of several trainings, so you can just run Aim UI:
- `aim ui --package asp`

Otherwise, run your own trainings:
1. Install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Make sure the latest version of Aim is installed
3. Run `python train.py`
